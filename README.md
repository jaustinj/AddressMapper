# AddressMapper

The following repo is made to take a list of addresses and return a csv with the addresses,lat and lon using the GOOGLE MAPS API.

Input your Google API, which you can get from here: 
[Google API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start), a path to an output file, 
and a list of addresses into the config.py file and you are good to go!  Simply run the python script with the requirements.txt file installed and you'll get your desired output!  Have fun!
